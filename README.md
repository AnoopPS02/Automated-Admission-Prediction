DESCRIPTION:

The idea behind this project is to predict the 'chance of admit'during filing an application for Master Studies.
Based on what kind of data is provided we determine the students chance of admit.
The important parameters that are considered during this process are
1.GRE Score
2.TOEFL Score
3.University rating
4.Statement of purpose
5.Undergraduate GPA
6.Research Experience
7.chance of admit

Following steps occur in this process:
1.We will be building the following models to predict the chance of admit 
->MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSOR
->RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR
->MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSOR with PCA
->RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR with PCA
2.We will plot the actual and predicted values for all four models and also the most significant features against output y_pred
3.Hence by building all the models mentioned aboe we will be able to predict the 'chance of admit
