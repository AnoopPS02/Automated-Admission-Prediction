<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>

The idea behind this project is to predict the 'chance of admit' during filing an application for Master studies.</br>
The important parameters that are considered during this process are:</br>
1. GRE Score</br>
2. TOEFL Score</br>
3. University rating</br>
4. Statement of purpose</br>
5. Undergraduate GPA</br>
6. Research Experience</br>
7. Chance of admit</br>

Following steps occur in this process:</br>

1.We will be building the following models to predict the chance of admit</br>
 -> MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSOR</br>
 -> RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR</br>
 -> MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSOR with PCA</br>
 -> RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR with PCA</br>

2.We will plot the actual and predicted values for all four models and
  also plot the most significant featurs against output y_pred.</br>

3.Hence by building all the models mentioned above we will be able to predict the 'chance of admit'.</br>
